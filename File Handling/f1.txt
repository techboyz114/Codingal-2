A tiny seed within the heart,

Where silent wishes often start.

With steady hands and honest toil,

Ambition breaks the hardened soil.

From whispered dream to soaring height,

It turns the darkness into light.

Where the courage softly grows,

With the strength the spirit shows.

Where the hope the soul can see,

With the faith the heart walks free.

Where the stars the path ignite,

With the will the future bright.
